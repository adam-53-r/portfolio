# > About me
Hi, my name is Adam. I'm a spanish computer science student at the [University of Barcelona](https://web.ub.edu/en/home)
and this is my personal web page where you can learn more about me, my interests, my qualifications and projects i've worked
and are working on.

## Interests
I have a great passion for systems administration and systems programming, I've also been working on numerous projects
both personal and for enterprises with multiple technologies.

## Tooling
For all my work I mainly use the following:
- Linux for all my server necessities, i've used a lot of distros but nowadays I'm settling down with [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)
for all its [advantages](https://itsfoss.com/why-use-nixos/).
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as my main programming language to use as long as it suits the necessities.
- [Nix](https://nixos.org/) as my main package manager and tooling thanks to its enormous repository size and flexibility.
- [Mikrotik](https://mikrotik.com/) as my go-to network solution for routers, switches and firewalls thanks to its simple but large and extensible configuration.
